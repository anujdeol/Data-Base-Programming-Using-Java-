Assignment 5

1.
In ca.myjava.query package
•
The two classes should do the same task
-
query the Country table in your Oracle
database and show the info of countries which have LifeExpectancy between two values.
•
Use static SQL (Statement) or PreparedStatement to perform the query as described by
the class names.

The class is imported to allow for JDBC functionality.
The "SqlInfo" class is imported to retrieve database connection information.
The main method is defined.
The MySQL JDBC driver is loaded using the "Class.forName" method.
A connection to the database is established using the "DriverManager.getConnection" method.
A PreparedStatement is created using the SQL query string "SELECT * FROM COUNTRY WHERE lifeexpectancy BETWEEN 10 AND 80". This is a parameterized query, allowing for the use of variables to replace certain parts of the query.
The PreparedStatement is executed using the "executeQuery" method, which returns a ResultSet.
The ResultSet is iterated through using a while loop, printing out each row's "Country" and "Life Exp" data.
If any exceptions occur during the process, an error message is printed out




2.
In ca.myjava.unknown package
Code the AnySQL class which accepts user’s input of SQL command from the console
and execute the command using
JDBC API. Show the query results or info of excuting
the SQL command on the console.


This program allows a user to enter any SQL command and execute it on a MySQL database using JDBC. The program uses a Scanner object to take user input for the SQL command to execute. It then creates a Statement object and executes the SQL command using the executeQuery() method. Finally, it loops through the ResultSet object to print out the results of the query.





3.
In ca.myjava.update package
•
Use the three classes to run 3 SQL statements: insert, update and delete on the Country
table. Each class will run only one of the
above SQL statements.
•
The approach to run the SQL statement for each class is described by the class name



The class is imported to allow for JDBC functionality.
The "SqlInfo" class is imported to retrieve database connection information.
The main method is defined.
The MySQL JDBC driver is loaded using the "Class.forName" method.
A connection to the database is established using the "DriverManager.getConnection" method.
Four PreparedStatements are created: one for inserting a new row, one for updating an existing row, one for deleting a row, and one for selecting all rows from the table.
Each PreparedStatement is executed using the "executeQuery" method.
The ResultSet is iterated through using a while loop, printing out each row's "Country" and "Life Exp" data.
If any exceptions occur during the process, an error message is printed out.
